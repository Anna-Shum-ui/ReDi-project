# ReDi-project
Iâ€™d like to build a fortune wheel app where the user types a question, spins a visual wheel with possible answers like yes/no/maybe/possible, and gets a random result.
After the answer, the app also gives a daily quote or piece of advice.
MVP: Basic wheel with answers.
Phase 2: Quote of the day and styling.
Phase 3: Themed responses, small interaction history, or effects.

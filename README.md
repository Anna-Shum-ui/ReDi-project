ReDi-project
Iâ€™d like to build a fortune wheel app, where the user types a question, spins a visual wheel with possible answers such as yes / no / maybe / possible, and receives a random result.
After showing the answer, the app will also display a daily quote or piece of advice (using an API).

MVP:
User can input a question
A loading/thinking state appears
Then an answer (yes/no/maybe/possible) is shown randomly
(initially without the spinning wheel)

Phase 2:
Add the quote of the day feature using an external API
Improve visual styling

Phase 3:
Add the visual spinning wheel
Add interaction history
Optional: add effects or themed responses
